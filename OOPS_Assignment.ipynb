        "Q1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:It ia a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects which can contain data and code to manipulate the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Advantages of oops:\n",
        "\n",
        "1)Code reusability\n",
        "\n",
        "2)Improved data security\n",
        "\n",
        "3) easier maintainance & Debugging\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: A class is a blueprint/Template for creating an object .\n",
        "\n",
        "A class contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "Attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is defined by a keyword class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:An objject is real world entity created from a class .It contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "Data(Attributes or properties)\n",
        "Functions(Methods or behaviours)\n",
        "Many objects can be created from the same class\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Abstraction: Concept of hiding a complex implementation.It hides un needed details & exposing the required.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract class cannot be initated\n",
        "Abstract class should always be subclass\n",
        "Abstract class may contain methods that are declared but not implemented in the abstract\n",
        "Abstraction can be acheived by using abstract class by importing import abc\n",
        "Encapsulation:It means to hide something or binding data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit and restricting the direct access to some of the object componenets.\n",
        "\n",
        "It helps to protect data from un authorized access and modification\n",
        "It is acheived by using private protected variables(__var/_var)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Dunder methods (short for double underscore) are special built in methods in python.They are aslo called magic methods. It lets you define how yourr objects behave with built -in python operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "E.g:init,str,add etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans. It is a core concept in oops that allows a class to inherit its properties and behaviours from another class There are 5 types of Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single Inheritance : one child inherits from one parent\n",
        "Multilevel Inheritance : one class inherits from another class which itself is derived from another class creating a chain of inheritance.\n",
        "Multiple Inheritance : one child inherits from multiple parents\n",
        "Hierarchical Inheritance : Multiple children inherit from one parent\n",
        "Hybrid Inheritance : multiple types /combination of different inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Poly means Many and morphism means forms/States.It refers to an object taking several forms depending on the method /data.\n",
        "\n",
        "It Takes Place in two ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "Method overiding : Method in parent class and child class with same signature ,The child class method will be executed.\n",
        "Method Overloading: A method taking different forms the last method overloads the previous methods. Python doesnot support true overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Encapsulation :It means to hide something or binding data and the methods that operate on the data into a single unit and restricting the direct access to some of the object componenets.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is acheived by using access modifier ,There are 3 types of access modifiers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Public: Accessible from anywhere from outside/inside the class\n",
        "Private: The data and method is only accessible within the class .it is defined by double underscore variable name (__)\n",
        "Protected : within the class and its sub class,It can be accessed by (_)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:A constructor is a special method in python thats automatically called when you create an object of a class .Its main job is to initialize the objects attributes .It sets up the object with initial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:In Python ,both class methods and static methods are methods that belong to a class ,but they are used differently and serve different purpose\n",
        "\n",
        "Class Method :\n",
        "\n",
        "belongs to the class not the instance.\n",
        "Takes cls as the first parameter(not self).\n",
        "Can access and modify class-level variables.\n",
        "Declared using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "Static Method :\n",
        "\n",
        "Doesn't take self or cls as the first parameter.\n",
        "Cannot access or modify class or instance variables.\n",
        "used for utility/helper function that are related to the class,but dont need access to class or instance data.\n",
        "Declared using the @staticmethod decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: unlike java or c++ python doesnot support method overloading directly if you define a method multiple times with same method name,the last one overrides all the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Method overiding : Method in parent class and child class with same signature ,The child class method will be executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The property decorator in python is used to turn a method into a \"getteer\"-- allowing you to access it like an attribute ,without calling it like a method.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is accessible by @property\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Polymorphism is a key pillar of oop that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Importance of Polymorphism:\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Reusability\n",

        "Extensibility\n",
        "Flexible interfaces\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:An Abstract class in python is a class that cannot be instanited directly .It is used as a blueprint for other classes and it may contain one or more abstract methods.To define a common interface for a group of related classes.to enforce that subclasses must implement certain methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "python uses the abc(Abstract Base Classes)module:\n",
        "from abc import ABC\n",
        "\n",
        "class Animal(ABC): #inherit from abc @abstractmethod def sound(self): Pass\n",

        "\n",
        "Q17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:In oops ,class variables and instance variables are both used to store data in a class -but they both are not same .\n",
        "\n",
        "Class variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "Shared across all instances of a class.\n",
        "belongs to the class ittself.\n",

        "Instance Variable:\n",
        "\n",
        "Unique to each object.\n",
        "Belongs to the object ,not the class.\n",
        "Defined using self inside __ init __() method or other instance methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Multiple Inheritance : one child inherits from multiple parents.This means a child class can combine the features(attributes and methods) of multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "E.g:class Parent1: def method1(self): print(\"Method from Parent1\")\n",
        "\n",

        "Q19.Explain the purpose of ‘’str’ and ‘repr’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:in python ,both __ str __ () and __ repr__ () are dunder methods used to define how your objects are represented as strings\n",
        "\n",
        "__ str __ (self):\n",
        "defines the user friendly or readable string representation of an object.\n",
        "called by the print() function and str()\n",
        "__ repr __(self):\n",
        "Defines the official ,devloper facing string representation of object.\n",
        "called by repr(),or when inspecting objects in the consoles,logs etc..\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20.What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The super() function in python is used to call methods from a parent in a child class .it allows you to access inherited methods without eplicitly naming the parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax: super().method_name(arguments)\n",
        "\n",
        "Q21. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:The __ del __() method in python is a special(dunder) method known as the destructor.It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed,allowing you to perform cleanup actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "def __ del__ (self):\n",
        "\n",
        "Q22.What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Both @staticmethod and @classmethod are decorators used to define methods that arent regular instance methods,but they serve differently and behave differently.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.@classmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "belongs to the class,not the instance\n",
        "Takes cls as the first argument\n",
        "Can access or modify class variables.\n",
        "can be called on the class or an instance.\n",
        "2.@staticmethod:\n",
        "\n",
        "Also belongs to the class ,but doesnot takes self,cls.\n",
        "Behaves like a regulare function,but lives inside the class namespace\n",
        "cannot access instance(self) or class(cls) data *used for utility/helper functions related to the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q23.How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:Polymorphism is a key pillar of oop that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it works with Inheritance:\n",
        "\n",
        "When a child class overrides a method from its parent class,and you use a common reference to call that method--python uses the actual objects version of the method\n",
        "\n",
        "Q24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: Method chaining is a programming technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line ,one after another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each method returns the object itself(self),allowing the next method to be called on that same object--like links in a chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "Syntax:\n",
        "\n",
        "object.method1().method2().method3()\n",
        "\n",
        "Q25. What is the purpose of the call method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans: The __ call __() in a class you can call instances of that class using parentheses() - just like you'd call a regular function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use __ call __():\n",
        "\n",
        "To make objects behave like functions.\n",
